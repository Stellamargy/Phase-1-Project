## Languages Used
This website has been made using three languages; html, Css and Javscript. Html was used to come up with the structure of the website. The Css was used in styling while the JavaScript increased the interactivity of the website. I also used an API from "https://www.themealdb.com/api.php". This API consists of a collection of recipes from which we can access from the site.
